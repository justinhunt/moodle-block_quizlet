How to install on a moodle 2.x site.
-------------------------------------------
Method One
1.- Visit your Moodle site's "site administration -> plugins -> install plugins" page, 
2.- Choose "block" and drag the quizletquiz.zip folder into the "ZIP Package" area.
3.- Follow the on screen instructions to complete the installation 
NB If the "blocks" folder does not have the correct permissions you will see a warning message
and will need to change the permissions, or use Method Two

Method Two
1.- Unzip the quizletquiz.zip archive to your local computer.
2.- This should give you a folder named "quizletquiz".
3.- Upload the "quizletquiz" folder to your [moodle site]/blocks/ folder using FTP or CPanel.
4.- Visit your Admin/Notifications page so that the block gets installed. 
 This will not create any tables in your moodle database.

For both methods, at the end of the installation process, the plugin configuration settings will be displayed.
These are explained below. They may be completed at this point, or at any time, by visiting the plugin settings page.

Configuring block QuizletQuiz for Moodle 2.x
--------------------------------------------------------------

Plugin Settings for QuizletQuiz Block 
***********************************************
The settings for the QuizletQuiz block can be found at:
[Moodle Site]/Site Administration -> Plugins -> Blocks -> QuizletQuiz

The most important of the settings are the 2 API keys from Quizlet.com. 
You need to make these over at quizlet.com once you are logged in there. They are free.
i)  Go to https://quizlet.com/api-dashboard
ii) Create an "application", and call it PoodLL (or anything you like).
iii) For the redirect URL of your site, just use the base URL of your Moodle site. eg.
http://mysite.com/moodle or http://moodle.mysite.com
iii) Copy and paste both keys into the settings pages for the block.
You can only make one "application" per quizlet account. It is only used when creating quizlet activities or import xml files.
Your students will not need to login to quizlet or be aware of any of this. You only need one set of keys per Moodle site.
You will use the same keys for the QuizletImport module and the QuizletQuiz block.

The final setting indicates the number of term/definition pairs that should make up a single Moodle matching question.

How to Add a Quizlet Quiz Block to a Page

Using block QuizletQuiz for Moodle 2.x
--------------------------------------------------------------

A. Export from Quizlet to Moodle quiz XML file
***********************************************

   1. From a page displaying the QuizletQuiz block, choose "Export Questions from Quizlet."

   2. Use the search form at the top of the export page to either:
    i) display all the currently logged in user's quizlet sets
    ii) search for keywords in set titles
    iii) display all quizlet sets for a specified Quizlet userid.

   3. From the search results, select the quizlet sets to export. They can be previewed without leaving the page, by pressing the preview button.

   4. Select from any or all of the 3 question types supported, multichoice, short answer and matching.
Multiple choice questions will consist of the following elements:
    * question text = glossary entry definition
    * correct answer = glossary entry concept
    * distracters = 3 incorrect options from the same quizlet set.

You have a choice of 4 types of numbering for the exported multiple choice questions:
    * a., b., c. (the default numbering type)
    * A., B., C., D.
    * 1., 2., 3.
    * no numbering

Short answer questions require the student to enter manually the correct answer.
    * Case insensitive. Student responses will be accepted as correct regardless of the original term (uppercase or lowercase).
          o Example: original entry "Moodle". Accepted correct responses: "Moodle", "moodle".
    * Case sensitive. Student responses will be only be accepted as correct if the text AND case match that of the original term.
          o Example: original entry "Moodle". Accepted correct response: "Moodle".

Matching questions make sets of term and definition pairs. Students must select the correct term from a drop down list to match the displayed definition.
The number of term/definition pairs that make up a single matching question is determined by the matching question subquestion count setting in the Quizlet Quiz settings.
The number of matching questions generated per Quizlet set will be the number of terms in the Quizlet set divided by the matching question subquestion count.
